TwitStream
==========

A small project that displays twitter streams that match the keywords entered.

I created this project for Hall. The objective was to receive input from the user (a list of keywords), and then use those keywords to first connect to the Twitter Streaming API, and then display in real time the tweets that contained said keywords.
